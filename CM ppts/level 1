Bismillah 



G aoa And,,,, i warmly welcome,,,



all participants to this cm level 1 training program



.. here with you i m m s haoor assit managr from config mang
deptt,



before starting our todays session,,, I would like to brief
you about the  cm  training programs.



There are actually 
two types of cm trainings , 



Level 1 and level 2 conducted by cm deptt each year



Level 1 is a kind of 
preliminary training program while on the other hand  level 2 is a detailed or u can say an
advanced training program. Which is more close to practical knowledge of cm



but as u know that 
this week of november is allocated for 
level 1 trainings  and   Level 2 trainings inshaAllah  will be held in  upcoming months



so as far as cm level 1 training program is concerned, it
is  comprised of 6 sessions, and we will
try to close out this training program till Friday of this week. 



Today our first session will be held on cm introduction. But
Tomorrow on Tuesday, sessions wouldnt  
be conducted bcz of unavailability of this nsd hall. so wwe will
continue our next sessions from wed to onward,      and on the last day of this training
program , hopefully on friday, a basic test will be conducted to asses your
understandings and comprehensions about cm. 



That test would be in mnqs formatand wouldn’t be that much
difficult, 



If someone attends the entire program he can easily, attempt
thattest



Also the slides  will
be shared with you after completion of eaxh session.. by hrd representative.
also u can contact her on her lync to get 
these slides on your lan pcs



 



So I hope this entire training program will be very much
insight ful for you



 



during the session  if
you have any query u can inteerupt me and ask your question. otherwise although
a timeslot is allocated for qa at the end of each session.  so you may ask your  questiions or clarifies your quiries after in
that timeslot too.



 



 



 as i have
introducedbmyself to you and about this training program. , so this would be
great if u people introduce yourself to me 
in order to make this session an interactive one. 



 



so agr ap apna nam department  aur the projects on which you are working on
yeah btaty chlein to us k bad hum aj k session ka baqaida agaz krty hain. 



so i think we can start from 
my right side. 



 



 



ok thanku so much 



so it seems that among our audience majority belongs to
program management



. hmari program management jin projects pay kam kr re hoti
hai un may cm to involve zroor hoti ha. i am sure after attending todays
session you will get an idea about core functionalities of cm dept.



 



 



_______



sooo as i have already said that our todays session is an
introductory session, is may apko cm ka basic introduction dea jaye ga



 



 



 



 



AJ KA SESSION 
introductory session ho ga



APKO AJKAY SESSION KE TIMELINE KE TRF LAY K CHLTA HN.



 basically this is the
overview of todays  ppt. 



like in  our first
section,, will elaborate that what is cm. what its stand for,  and how we can define cm in basic terms. 



so all theseeeeew areas will be covered in 1st section



 



our second section is about roots of cm, this section will
demonstrate the origin of cm, from where did cm begin, what standards amd
procedures we have on cm.  and which
organizations and institutions have adopted this discipline.



 



 



Then their comes the 3rd section which is about why we need
cm? what its purpose,.



 what are the perks or
benefits we can get by implmenting cm in the system?



and what woulf happen if cm is not incorporated in life
cycle.



sath he sath cm kesy alplicable hoti hai hamary product pay
wo hum dekhein gy



 



then there is a  last
section, this is most significant sections of todays ppt...... in this section
i will breif u about five principal elements of cm. on which cm actually relies



 the comprehsive
sessions on each of these five principal elemnts will be held subseqently on
upcoming days. but today i will just describe u about  these 
elements very concsiley, not in detail.



so this was the summary of todays session.



 



so this was a kind of time line which briefs you that our
todays session will proceed. 



______________



now we should  start
with our  first section, in which i will
define cm





cm stands for config. manag. 



and the term configuration has two meanings. 



first one is the relative arrangement pf interconnected
parts of product



by this it means that 
how different parts or elements are combined or arranged together to
produce a particular form figure or combinatiom and whwnever a single component
changes then how it would afect all other jnterrelated parts.....



so this is what it meant by relative arragemenent of
interconnected part.



And  the second
definition of the  term configuration
is,,,, functional and physical atributes of product



so in order to explain functional and physical attrib.    we have added an expamle of gear box.



this gear box has both functionl and pphys attributes.



physical attributes are like, no. of gears in gear box,
specific dia of each of gears, material, by which the gears are
manufacture,  color of gears.



so all  these
parameters  are the physical attributes
of gear box



and funxtional attributes are like rpm or speed of gears,
directions  in which gears will rotate,
clockwise or anticlock wise



now i think you have got an idea about the fnc and phys
attributea



as well as you have got an idea, about the term
configuration, now we can define cm..



so configuration managemnt is a discipline thst manages
functional and physical attribute  as
well as controll the reltaive arrangement of interconnected parts of product.



so this is how we can define cm in basic term..



 



____________



 



 



our subsequent section is on roots of cm.



so initially cm was adopted by some  classified organizations those who were
manufacturing critical equipments and products and  if their products failed the results could be
catastrophic like...



death/seriois injury to user



loss/sever damage to equipmemt



env harms 



or the organziation have to spend a lot of money  or substantail cost for repair/renovation of
equipment IN case of failur of device.



in order to avoid such svere conditions, some organizarions
took a step and thry started ,,, controlling configurations of products in form
of technical documentation.. 



after doing so ,they were able to produce very reliable,
consistent and accurate products



so this is what cm does.



HUM KEA KRTY HAIN K we actually control the comfiguration of
product right from concept phase to the final production in tdps i.e. technical
data packs. a folder that contains all the technical documents.(this is kind of
folder in which all technical docs are consolidated)



 





so these are some organizations i have listed down in which
cm was adopted and practiced at first



medical equip manifaturers



nuclear engineering departments



 military organization



and ofcourse the  aero
space organizarions.



now its time to move to our next section



 



in here i will share,, 
some historical background of cm stds.



back in 1950, although cm was  not recognized as a separate disixplime



but at that time, dept of defense in united states started
to use this process for the technical doxumentation of their hardware
items.  so that was the origin of cm. 



afterwards,, from 1960 to 1970, department of defenxe
released a series of military standards.



mil std 480,481, 483 on config control, on enginweirng
changes, and on cm practices respectively.



also in 1962, air force system  command manual on configuration managemnt was
issued



so in this era cm was actually recognized as a technical
discipline.



 



then in 1987, ieee (institue of eletrical and electronics
engineers)  released a guideline on
software config manag. prior to this std only harwdware items were under config
control and sw items were not faciliated. 



then in 1992, mil std 973 was emerged that was a
conslidation of previously released mil std 480, 481, 483.



 MATLAB K JO HAMARAY
PEHLY STADNADRD AYE THY 480, 481, 483 UNEIN CONSOLIDATE KRK AIK STANDRD BNA DEA
GYA WUR WO THA MIL STD 973.



in 1998, config manag. guideline handbook was published



this is how cm was establishing back in 20th century.



 



in 21st century ,electronic industries alliances develop a
std. that was national consensus std for config. mang. and ALSO IN 2015 EIA Std
for Nasa enterpise was released.



So this was the history of some cm standards

CM APPLICABILTY KE BAT KR LETY HAIN,



basically cm is applicable through out a project life cycle,because




because   its an on
going process ,  it starts right from the
concept phase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and remains
continues until the final production and delivery of product..



cm ka std hmein yeh btata k what type of documents you have
to prepare for a particular phase. 



APKO KO AIK SLIGHT SA IDEA DENY K LEAY K CM THROUGH OUT A
PROJECT KESY APPLY HOTI HA. MENY KUCH DOCUMENTS HIGHLIGHT KEAY HAIN LIFE CYCLE

US K BAD APKA MODEL MASS PRODUCTION K LEAY READY HO JATA



TO YEAH APKO OVERVIEW DENAY K LEAY THA K DIFFERENT PHASES
PAY DIFFERENT DOCS CONTROL KRWAYE JATAY HAIN



 



US K BAD SECTION AA JATA K HUMEIN Q ZROORT HAI CM KE



this section is about objectives of cm  , that why we need cm, bcz there is  a huge misconception among alot of people
about cm, they thought that   we dont
need to get involved in documentation of our product as it slows down our
production process and it's time consuming 



 



but the fact is , if cm in implemeneted in its true sense,
it helps to meet  scheduled deliveries
and induces accuracy in products



 



moreover cm is a standard.



although some people think that staandards and procedures
are useless.



but the fact is that standrds tell us the best way to do
somethinG



and as cm is also a standrd and it tells us what is the best
way  to control the configuration of
product.,



therefore its a necessity to utilize this  std. in order to make our products consistent
with eaxh other





 



some renowned manufacturers of automotive  and celluar phone  have also incorporated cm in their products
life cyxle.. because they have to work with multiple configurations at a same
time and they have to manage several variants of  a product in parallel,. so thats why these
organization are also showing compliance/confrlance to cm standards. ok



_______________





in this section our focus is on consistent configurations.



because cm actually provides accuracy and consistency in
manufactured products.



and if cm is not incorporateed in the life cycle then your
similar products might be inconsistent with each other.



for example we 
manufacture  a product.**and for
the first time it meets all target requirements,



but if  the technical
dcumentation are not controlled . so it would cause inconsistencies for future
products.



anddd when you go for your second product,* it might
possible that because of some minr inconsistencies your second product might
not achieve the target requirements..



***and there is also another scenario that if
inconsistencies are major then the results could be catastrophic. 



so from this section we conclude, that lack of cm causes
inconsistent configurations.



 



________________



 



in this slide, i m going to compare the two scenarios. one
is ignoring cm and second is adopting cm. and then  i will present u , the implications of both
of these scenr



there are also several other consequences an organization
might face because of lack of cm.



AGR APP APNY PROJECT K START MAY CM KO IGNORE KRTY HAIN, and
you think that their is no need to control the technical documentation of your
product.  in start you might feel k APP
KA BURDEN KM HO GYA HA. APKO DOCUMENTS NAI BANANY  PR RY, APKO CHANGES KO  CONTROL NAI KRWANA PR RA. soit seens like
that in initial phases your engineering efforts are very much reduced. but the
result of this would be unmanageable 



for example a fault pops out during testing and you want to
traceback then you cant TRACEBACK the origin of fault promplty whether it is a
requirement error or design or fabrication because you didnt control your
technical doxumentation after each phase. so at that time  ypur engineeering efforts would be veey much
elevated. bcz cm would nt be there for you.



APKA APNI CHANGES K OPER KOI CONTROL NAI HO GA. AUR AP
SYSTEM MAY ANAY WALAY DEFECTS KO AUR SYSTEM KE SHORT COMINGS KO TRACEBACK NAI
KR PAO GAY... 



APP KO DOBARA ZERO SAY START KREIN GY. AP kA BUHT SA TIME
REWORK MAY LG JAYE GA.



in contrast to this, if you liason with cm from initial
phases of your product development



in start you might have to put some effort to inline your
documents with the standards. but when it will be  streamlined, 
then it would be very easy for you to manage your production line. and
you can traceback all authorized changes in the product. 



then your engineering efforts,  would be very reduced for future. 



INI BATOON KO AGAY HIGHLIGHT KEA GYA K CM K BGAIR
DOXUMENTATION TO EXIST KRTI HAI. LEKIN AP KA PRODUCT AUR APKY DOCUMENTS
COHERENT NAI HOTAY.  JESY K APKA PART KOI
MAJOR FUNCTIONALITY PERFORM KR RA HO GYA PR WO FUNCTIONALITY TRACEBACK NAI HO
PAA RE HO GE DOCUMENTS MAY. JB AP CM KRTY O TO APP K PARTS AUR FUNCTIONALTIES
DOCUMENTS MAY TRACEBACK HO RE HOTEIN HAIN



 



CM NA HONAY KE WJA SAY HOTA YEAH HA K BUHT C UNCROLLED
CHANGES SYSTEM MAY INDUCE HO JATI HAIN



APKO APNY SYSTEM MAY VISIBILITY NAI MIL RE HOTEIN.  



AP APNY CHANGE PROCESS KO MONITOR NAI KR PATAY



APKO DOBARA REWORK KRNA PRTA Q K APKI REQUIREMENTS CLEAR NAI
HOTEIN…..



AUR YEAH B HOTA K APKI APROVED CHANGES APKY PRODUCT MAY
INCORPRATE NAI HOE HOTEIN



so because of all  of
these factors you have to experience difficulty in mainting your product.



 



these are the five principal elements ,on which cm relies. 



first one is planning, second is identification, third is
change control, fourth is status accounting and fifth is reviews and audits.



so here  is a
comphrensive definition of cm based on principal elements of cm. 



cm provide technical surveillenace 



to identify functional, physical and performance  characteristics of items



and then control chamges and basline  those char..



providing status about those chrs.



and finally conduct audit on compliance of those chrs.





CM PLANNING



YEAH SECTION CM PLANNING K BARAY MAY HA



JB KOI B PRJOCT START 
HOTA. TO US K LEAY CM  deptt KE
TRF SY kuch  RESOURCE ALLOCATE KEAY JATAY
HAIN u.CMO AUR CMC ALLOCATE KEAY JATAY HAIN 
CONFIG MNG OFFICERS AUR COORDINATORS.



JO K US PROJECT Ke CONFIGURATION KO MANAGE  KRTY HAIN.



JB RESOURCES ALLOCATE HO JATAY HAIN.TO US PROJECT KE
REQUIREMENTS KO DEFINE KEA JATA , K IS PROJECT MY KON KON SY CONFIGURATION
ITEMS HON GY AUR KIS KIS LEVEL PY INDICATE 
HN GY



PHR UN CIS SAY RELVENT PROCESSES AUR ACTIVITIES KO MENTION
KEA JATA



K IN CIS PAY CHANGE CONTROL KA PROCESS KESY IMPLEMENT HO GA.
IN KE STATUS ACCOUNTING KESY KE JYE GE, AUR IN K AUDIT KE ACTIVITY KB AUR KESY
PERFORM KEAY JAEIN GY





US K SATH E ROLES AND RESPONSIBILTIES DECLARE KR DEIN JATEIN
HAIN e.g. PM project eng QC cmo



WOHI CHEZAIN JO MENY APKO PICTORIAL FORM MY DEKGEIN HAIN
UNEIN TEXTUAL FORM MY DAIKH LEIN



K HUM PLANNING MAY KEA KRTY HAIN



K WHAT CM ACTIVITES ARE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED K KSI SPECIFIC
PROJECT K LEAY KON KON C CM ACTIVITIES PRRFORM KE JAEIN GE. 



AUR UN ACTIVITIES KA PROCEDURE K WO KESY PERFORM KEIN JAEIN
GEIN.



THEN WHO IS RESPONSIBLE



AND WHEN THOSE.ACTIVITIES PERFORMED. BASICSLLY THE SCHEDULE
OF ACTIVITIES.



ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED.



AND WHEN CM PLAN SHALL BE REVIEWD. UPDATED AND APPROVED.



K CM PLAN KO KB REVIEW KEA JAYE GA, KB KB UPDATE KEA JAYE GA



 



after that a document of cm plan with dmt 571



will be prepared and this will refelct that how config mang
would be applicable for a particular program. 



 



identification is started with part numbering



4 digit project code air 6 digit part identifier hota ha. 



 



Identification part numberimg sy start hpti ha.



Sb sy pehly ap k project ko 4 digit ka project code a lot
kea jata.



Aur us project may use honay wali cis assmeblies aur
manufactured item ko 6 digit ka part identifier a lot kea jata.



Sath e ap k documents k leay data media type a lot jo k
dpcument identifiers.



AP NAY SYSTEM LEVEL PAY KIN KIN CHEEZON KO IDENTIFY KRNA



APKI CIs KON C HAIN. 



APKI ASSEMBLIES AUR SUBASSEMBLIES KON C HAIN



AP K MANUFACTURED ITEM KON SAY HAIN JO AWC MAY MANUFACTURE
HO RY HAIN, AUR K BOUGHT OUTS KON SAY HAIN, JO K AP BAHIR KSI VENDOR SAY
PROCURE KR RY HAIN.



YEAH SB CHEEZAIN AP APNI FAMILY TREE K OPER IDENTIFY KR RY
HOTAY HAIN..



FAMILY TREE AIK ESA DOC HOTA JIS MAY APNY APNY PRODUCT KA
BREAK DOWN STRUCTURE BNAYA JOTA. JO K 2 LEVLES PAY BNTA. AIK HOTA SYSTEM LEVEL
AUR DOSRA HOTA EQUIPMENT LEVEL



 



AUR IS FAMILY TREE MAY HE AP JO ITEMS MENTION KRTY HAIN UN K
SATH BNANAY WLAY JITNY BE REQUIRED TECHNICAL DOCS HOTAY HAIN. UNKE DMTS MENTION
KR DETY HAIN



 



ABI MEIN APKO AIK FAMILY TREE DEKHATA HN.



YEAH AIK DUMMAY FAMILY TREE HAI JO K MENY AIK COFFEE MAKER
SYSTEM K LEAY PREPARE KE HAI



AP DAIKH SKTY HAIN K MENY ISY PROJECT CODE ALOT KEA 4 DIGITS
KA 0233



AUR SATH E HEX ZEOS KA SYSTEM IDENTIFIER DEA JO K YEAH
INDICATE KR RA HOTA K YEAH IS PRODUCT K SYSTEM LEVEL HA. 



AGR BREAK DOWN DEKHEIN COFFE MAKER KA TO US MAY 3 MAJOR
ASSEMBLIES HAIN. WATER AUPPLY KE ASSEMBLY HA, HOT WATER KE ASSEMBLY HA AUR
BEANS CONTAINER KE ASSEMBLEY HA.



KUCH HAMARY MANUFACTURED ITEMS HAIN. KESY WATER TANK HO GYA
AUR BEAN CONTAINER HO GYA. 



AUR FINALLY HMARY BOUGHT OUTS JO K BAHIR SAY PROCURE KEAY
JATAY HAIN.



MENY IDR THERMOSTAT KO INDICATE KEA HOA AS A BOUGHT OUT



SATH E AP K LEGENDS INDICATE HO RY HOTAY HAIN FAMILY TREE
MAY JAHAN SAY DAIKH K AP DIRECTLY BTA SKTY HAIN K YEAH CHEEZ AP KE ASSEMBLY HA
YEAH MANUFACTURE ITEM HA. AUR YEAH BOUGHT OUT HA



CONFIGURATION ITEMS KE KUCH PROPERTIES MENTIONS KE GAEIN
HAIN



YEAH WO ITEMS HOTAY HAIN JO DELIVERABLE HOTAY HAIN  AUR SEPARATELY INSTALLABLE HOTY HAIN 



 



YEAH IDENEPEMDEMTLY APNA END USE FUNCTION PERFORM KR SKTY
HAIN



 



IN KE CRITICAL NATURE HOTI HA IS LEAY IN KE DOXUMENTATION KO
CONTROL KRNA IMPORTAMT HOTA. Q K IN KE CONFIGURATIOM USUALLY MODIFY KE JA SKTI
HA.e.g. s/w



 



YEAH SECTION HAMARA STATUS ACCOUNTING K BARAY MAY HA.



 



STATUS ACCOUNTING MAY HR CI KA STATUS RECORD HOTA K
CURRENTLY YEAH CI KIS BASELINE PAY HA. AUR KITNI DOCUMENTATION IN WORK HAI
KITNI DOXUMENT RELEASE HA.  AUR KON KON C
CHANGE KB KE GAE ECP NUMBER K SATH INDICATION MIL RE HOTI…



STATUS ACCOUTING K 2 SYSTEMS HAIN. .MRI SYSTEM. JO K MADTER
RECODEX INDEX HA. AUR PDI SYSTEM JO K PRODUCT DATA INDEX. 



MRI SYSTEM is purana system ho jo k CI based status
accounting krta. 



Aur pdi system newly adopted system ha. 



Jo k assembly level aur ci level dono pay status accoutning
krta. 



Q k hr ci to assembly hoti ha. Pr hr assembly ci nai hoti…



PDI ke 2 types hain. Searilized product ke  pdi jo k with cover page hoti hai aur non
serialized product ke pdi jo k without cover page hoti ha..



 





if we talk about the perks of cm. 



so first of all cm provides verified accounting and
reporting of planned and final CIs, CI data and configuration
